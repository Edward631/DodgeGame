# DodgeGame
This project we were tasked to build a game. The game i picked was a dodge the enemy type of game. This progam will open up with a login page where you  will be asked to make a username and password for your user. After that you will be automaticly put into the game. In the game there is acid ("the red squares") and objectives ( "the blue squares"). You will need to dodge the red square and get the objective. If these are fulfilled then you will add to your score. if not you will get a game over in which your score will be added to a TXT file where your user info and score is stored. You may replay the game. To move your charater you can use the mouse, use the arrow keys on the key borad or you can use the button on the screen. I hope this game will be (at least a little) fun and intuitive. The code is still very clunky and has a few formatting error, the main one is how the showInputDialog for the login is not showing up. I wish i could have added sprites to the objects to make the game look better. To play the game simply add all the files and run the main method in the login class.
